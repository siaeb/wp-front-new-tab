# WP Front New Tab

Normally, when you’re in the WordPress admin section, you click on the “Visit Site” link in the admin bar to view the site.

This is a flaw, when you return to the WordPress admin section, you will always be redirected to the dashboard page and not to the page that you previously had.

This will cause you to lose that page when you are in a management page other than dashboard page .

Using this plugin, you can safely click on the site’s link without losing the current page, because your site will open in a new tab or window .

This plugin is very simple but very functional, especially if you are making changes on your WordPress site .
